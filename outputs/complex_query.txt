USER:
Research transformer architectures, analyze their computational efficiency, and summarize key trade-offs.

SYSTEM RESPONSE:
- Transformers use self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence.
- They are highly parallelizable, enabling faster training.
- Trade-off: High memory and computational cost due to attention over long sequences.

Agents involved:
- ResearchAgent (information retrieval)
- AnalysisAgent (reasoning and comparison)

Coordinator decisions:
- Classified query as complex
- Executed Research → Analysis pipeline

Memory:
- Analysis summary stored for future reuse.
